/**
 * Build the review directive injected into the main agent (hidden, via
 * `sendMessage` with `display:false` + `triggerTurn:true`).
 *
 * v0.7.0 contract (post-mortem from PR #18689 review):
 *   - chatProgress must be "auto" | "off" | "live-card" — anything else is
 *     rejected by pi-subagents schema validation.
 *   - Every reviewer child declares `cwd` (target workspace) and
 *     `outputSchema` so pi-subagents returns `result.structuredOutput`.
 *   - "inherit" reviewer models are NOT expanded into concrete model ids.
 *     The workflow script leaves `model:` off so the orchestrator keeps the
 *     inheritance link.
 *   - The gate consumes reviewer `structuredOutput` objects directly, never
 *     Markdown code fences.
 *   - Step 3 hands off to the `pi_review_report` tool, which is the only
 *     authoritative report renderer (deterministic code-side verdict).
